# Python_Red_List_v4

Python_Red_List_v4 is a python code for the IUCN Red List API v4 (https://api.iucnredlist.org/api-docs/index.html). IUCN Red List (https://www.iucnredlist.org/) is an inventory of the global conservation status and extinction risk of biological species. This package is a simple method for getting IUCN Red List Categories of species from an excel file. This is an easy way to get most recent assessments on species after a field work.

An API Key is needed for the code to work, for more information you can check (https://api.iucnredlist.org/).

Code works for Mediterranean and Global assessments for I am in a Mediterranean country. But it is possible to add other regional assessments. As such it is also possible to add other API functions too.

This was a project homework for my class, anyone who likes to use can use and add improvements on it.
